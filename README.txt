This repo is intended for use of learning how to effectively use Regular Expressions in Python.

words.txt and theVerge.txt are both sample text files used for testing this script.

RegSearcher.py is a script that allows user to select any file on their computer for Regular Expression searches, and then queries the user for Regex expressions to search.

Results are stored as objects in a global array, and can also be accessed in the script by the user. In future versions this result data will be stored in persistent storage.

Python 2.7.3 was used as the language version.
