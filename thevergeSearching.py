# Regex searching on large text file


# NOTE: Need to create a class for regex() search results. This 2D
# Array approach has limited capacity, and is not OOP centric.
# Objects are a better approach and should be implemented as
# soon as possible. Even if the search and get result functions
# are not a part of the class, the results should still be
# stored as objects.

# Ultimately, need to work out return sequence for values,

# Also, past search section needs work
# Need to figure out how to keep these as persistent values
# ^ sqlite may be the answer
